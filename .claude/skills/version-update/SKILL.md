# Version Update

Updates `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect a new release version.

---

## Step 1 — Read current version

Read `package.json` and extract:
- **`currentVersion`** — value of `packages[0].version` (e.g. `6.9.0`)
- **`currentSdkVerMin`** — value of `sdkVerMin` (e.g. `10.12.0`)

---

## Step 2 — Determine bump types

**Plugin bump type** — compare `new_version` against `currentVersion` using semver `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

| What changed | Bump type |
 --- || --- | --- || --- | --- || --- |
 --- || MAJOR digit increased | `major` |
| MINOR digit increased | `minor` |
| PATCH digit increased | `patch` |

**SDK bump type** (only when `native_sdk_version` provided) — compare `native_sdk_version` against `currentSdkVerMin` using the same rule. This prefix is used in the SDK CHANGELOG line.

---

## Step 3 — Update package.json

In `package.json`:
- Set `packages[0].version` → `<new_version>`
- If `native_sdk_version` was provided → set `sdkVerMin` → `<native_sdk_version>`

---

## Step 4 — Prepend CHANGELOG entry

Read `CHANGELOG.md` and check whether `# Release Date` already exists at the top.

**If `# Release Date` / `## Release Version` block already exists at the top:**
Append the new entries to the end of that existing block (do not add a new header):

```
# Release Date

## Release Version

- <existing entries>
- <changelog_entries line 1>        ← append here
- [<sdk_bump_type>] Updated MoEngage-iOS-SDK to <native_sdk_version>   ← append here if provided
```

**If no `# Release Date` block exists at the top:**
Prepend a new block at the very top:

```
# Release Date

## Release Version

- <changelog_entries line 1>
- <changelog_entries line 2>
- [<sdk_bump_type>] Updated MoEngage-iOS-SDK to <native_sdk_version>   ← only if native_sdk_version provided
```

Format rules (from existing CHANGELOG):
- Date line: literal `# Release Date` (placeholder — replaced during release)
- Version header: literal `## Release Version` (placeholder — replaced during release)
- Each entry: `- <text>` (no ticket number; SDK line uses `[<sdk_bump_type>]` prefix, feature entries do not)

---

## Step 5 — Print summary

```
Version:  <currentVersion> → <new_version>  (<bump type>)
sdkVerMin: <currentSdkVerMin> → <native_sdk_version>   ← only if provided

CHANGELOG entry added:
# Release Date
## Release Version
<entries>
```
